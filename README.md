The OperatorBot for the 2021 Great Midwest Trivia Contest!

The bot acts as an "Operator" for Discord. Trivia players join the "waiting
room" voice channel. The bot places these players "in queue", and tracks their
position. When a phone answerer is ready to take the call, they can type !phone
(or !answer, !next) in the operator channel to have the first player in queue
moved to their voice channel. Trivia Players are removed from queue if they
leave the waiting room for any reason.

Trivia Masters also have the ability to !clear the waiting room, and check the
bot's status.
